# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction Using Logistic Regression

This project uses Logistic Regression to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on various medical attributes. The dataset includes patient health records and is sourced from Kaggle. The goal is to classify whether a patient is likely to have heart disease or not.

## 📌 Project Overview

- Performed data cleaning, preprocessing, and standardization
- Split data into training and test sets using `train_test_split`
- Built and evaluated a logistic regression model using scikit-learn
- Achieved **81% accuracy** on the test set
- Visualized key insights using Matplotlib and Seaborn (e.g., heatmaps, distribution plots)

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Languages & Libraries:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **IDE/Tools:** Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset consists of anonymized patient records with features like age, blood pressure, cholesterol level, chest pain type, etc.
